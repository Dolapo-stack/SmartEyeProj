Technologies

Server: 
Python running on Flask framework
PostgreSQL database
SMS Gateway (Twilio API)

Server Environment setup
-----

- VS Code to run the python codes

- Android studio emulator

- In VS code go to "Open" then navigate to repo directory and open it

- After, go to menu and click "Terminal", then click "new terminal"

- To start building, we need to have pip installed (pip is a python package manager, we need it because Flask framework is a python package and it comes with other tools like; virttualenv, Werkzeug server, jinja templates...).

- Having install pip, we will run "pip install Flask"

- Then run "virtualenv server", Virtual env is a virtual box that creates another container for installing python packages, rather thaan installing project dependicies on the general directory, we use it to install on specific project only: For example: A machine learning projeect uses: numpy, sci-learn.. But a normal app uses maybe just Flask and Auth0 packages.
